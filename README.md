# Potato Map Game

# Game review
I implemented a game similar to Tetris. There are several types of blocks like town, water, mountain etc. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible from the missions. Two missions active in every season. If you have done some challenges which are not available yet, you will still get points later. There is a special mission: if you surround a block with other blocks, you get 1 point. The card shows the currently placeable element with its time unit. The game ends after 28 time units.
